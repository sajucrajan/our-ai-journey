One of the most trending research and development use case of AI is in <b>Cyber Security using AI</b> to help identify threats, prevent cyber-attacks and secure application development.  The average cost of a data breach in the United States costs around $8.19 Million in 2019 (Brook, n.d.).  The cyber-attacks and the hackers are finding new ways to breach systems that a human centric cyber security team will not be able to keep up with. Additionally, deploying AI System technology is not limited to cyber security team.  Even the cyber attackers are using AI technologies to identify vulnerabilities in systems that can be exploited to take advantage and cause a data breach.

But AI solutions to help in cybersecurity is not trivial since a lot of modernized applications are completely on the cloud and the internet where systems are most exposed for a cyber-attack.  The objective of AI in security is to most efficiently protect, detect and respond at the earliest. Most of the Machine Learnings and AI deployments are based on learnings from the past after processing and analyzing huge amounts of data using big data technologies. The past learnings via machine learning and indicators from traditional security techniques will definitely help in preventing previously encountered threats, but it will not really help for any new attacks or threat that have not be been discovered yet. Also AI system technology aims to help security professionals to reduce the tasks they do and only relevant data for them to analyze and avoid data overload.

AI System Technologies now needs to focus on "Threat Hunting" by deploying AI and big data technologies to identify vulnerabilities in a system and plug in the gaps well before cyber attackers get to deploy their on AI technologies for unethical purposes.

One such Threat Hunting methods that Microsoft developed is "Neural fuzzing" (Blum, 2017) by using machine learning and deep neural networks. This helps the Microsoft development and security team to identify conditions in the system that can cause errors that have high probability of being exploited by the hacking cyber attackers. Buffer overflows, memory access violations and null pointer issues are identified before the system is released to the wider audience that reduces the chances of the system subject to data breaches and security attacks. This will allow AI to participate during development to develop secure applications by default so that applications and systems are less vulnerable to security threats and attacks in the future and reduce the number of data breaches in the software industry. AI in cyber security can help in providing accuracy in detecting threats and vulnerabilities, accelerating the investigation and automating the responses. The category of using technologies to aid in averting security incidents fall under preventive software security & ethical AI hacking.

In the coming decade, Ethics in AI (TED, 2021) is going to be very relevant to keep AI free of biases of a developer or a developing company and be cognizant of the privacy that the consumers deserve.  Also data availability is multiply with the IoT (Internet of Things) which will need massive power in data analysis and storage.  So along with AI, system technologies to support data movement, data manipulation, data aggregation and data storage and retrieval is going to be vital to successfully use the available information for Machine Learning and using in making accurate decisions using Artificial Intelligence.
