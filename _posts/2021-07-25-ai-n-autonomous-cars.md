## Introduction
Artificial Intelligence and Autonomous Cars are two very hot topics that are joined at the hip and in most instances than not, need to be discussed together.  A completely autonomous car would necessarily mean that the car will be able to navigate its way from one point to another without any assistance from a human and along the journey have the capabilities to go through various traffic and weather conditions and also be enabled to handle various complex scenarios that may involve tangible life and death consequences to people inside the car and to people outside.

In the research and testing of autonomous cars, currently the application of AI is bound by the boundaries of information that is available from the different sensors, GPS, radar, cameras all coming from that specific individual car.  So it would mean that the AI embedded in such autonomous cars has to gather enough information to calculate and then assess/understand the environment to make decisions on what that car should do next.

But what if, the AI could get this information from the environment directly vs detecting from the environment.  That would mean that any systems that are part of a local environments are all connected and communicating to each other and passing on all necessary information about the current state of the system which would enable other AI embedded systems to then use this direct information along with the deduced information to then take a proper collective decision.  This would enable AI to provide decisions much faster leading to more options to avoid a catastrophic situation.

I believe that the future of AI is going to be enhanced with Internet of Things (IoT) and the availability of high speed data like 5G technologies that will enable, currently disjoined, different AI systems (autonomous cars) to communicate with each other in a certain range that would enable each AI system to work together and combine AI software's and IoT sensor information to ensure proper and safe driving conditions.

What kind of artificial intelligence should be embedded in autonomous cars?
1. The biggest and the foremost AI that needs to be embedded into any partial or complete autonomous car is Self-Driving Car Safety.  This would mean that the AI system can demonstrate that it can mitigate the risks during a drive better than a human being that may be affected by fatigue, misperception, distracted driving (i.e. texting) and even intoxication.  Such safety measures would include emergency control and breaking to avoid accidents, traffic signal detection and 360 degree monitoring.
2. Providing the human touch.  This is a very complex and complicated topic that questions how an AI would perform when put in a situation where an accident is unavoidable.  The area of ethical limitations of an AI system is definitely one such need that need to be researched and developed before embedding into an autonomous car.  The AI would then need to be capable to understand and apply human values, ethical relations or legal consequences of a AI decision to react or not react.
3. There could be a Predictive and Prescription Maintenance AI that can be performed based on information from the sensors and data from usage of the car to measure the health or condition of the car to avoid failures and perform timely maintenance to affected parts.

## What will it take to have autonomous driving be part of our daily life (on the policy level, infrastructure level, research level, etc.)?
From a policy level, the first step would be for governments to acknowledge and accept and enable change to infrastructure and additional researches that would enable and ensure safe and speedy rollout of the autonomous cars.  It would also be beneficial if governments start setting up regulatory panels that defines and regulates the production of autonomous cars and set the bars to very high standards that would ensure public safety and confidence before the autonomous cars begin rolling out to public domains.  There is also a need to start the process of rulemaking for autonomous cars because the current road safety rules and restrictions are only meant for humans and autonomous cars and incidents around the same have to be dealt with differently.

On an infrastructure level there would need to be lots of changes that could involve in setting up sensors and devices along the roads that autonomous cars could connect and gather information that could supplement the AI applied by the car itself.  As previously mentioned, availability of 5G high speed data for using IoT to boost the AI applications becomes pivotal.

From a research standpoint, the ethical limitations research is very important factor that sometimes is overlooked while focusing only on AI algorithm based safety measures.  More and more research funding from government and policy makers are very important to get autonomous cars a practical reality in the coming decade.

## When do you think this will happen?
In a capitalistic society, where space travel is about to be sold to private parties as a leisure trip by SpaceX and Virgin Galactic, autonomous cars are already part of a race that many technology companies like Tesla, Apple, Uber and Waymo are trying to reach first to the market.  Smaller startups that research about autonomous cars are being acquired by bigger companies to gain an edge in their own products.  But, are any of these research or company technologies mature enough to garner enough confidence from the government and society today?  Probably not!  At present, even companies donâ€™t have so much confidence that they themselves have disclaimers in their fine print to avoid any liabilities in case of failures.  This would suggest that we have at least a decade to go before confidence and maturity of the AI in autonomous cars is attained and the right regulations and rules are laid out to ensure majority public acceptance and affordability.
